# BaseSci

Welcome to BaseSci! This is a modpack that includes essential technical mods,
optimisation mods and Optifine-replacement mods. This modpack was originally
part of Sundawn MC, however due to Minecraft's change in update philosophy it
became impossible to keep Sundawn consistently up-to-date with the latest
Minecraft version.

This modpack aims to be an easy-to-install, easy-to-use one-stop shop for all
of your technical Minecraft needs. It simplifies installing the Masady and
Carpet mods on the latest version of Minecraft, and comes with the
Optifine-compatibility you've come to expect from modpacks like Fabulously
Optimized out-of-the-box.

The main goal of this pack is to keep up with the latest version of Minecraft.
Thus when a new version releases, it may become less stable for a little while
and may be missing some of the mods that it aims to have every version.

# Mods

In the following collapsible segments, the mods that every version of BaseSci
aims to have are listed. Keep in mind that depending on how new a version of
Minecraft is at that time, a version of BaseSci might not include all of these
mods.
